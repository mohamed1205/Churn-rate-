# Churn_rate 
In this  project I used Power bi  to explore and analyze the data to determine what is the reason that lead to increase churn rate ,and what is the decision  that we can make to reduce it.


1- Data check :
        -check if the count of customer_id = distinct count of customer_id.
        -this check is particularly important, because in case there are
         dublicated rows we might double count cost later.
         
2- Explore data :
        -churn rate = customer loss/total customer = 26.68 which is hight
        -I use hierarchies on "churn reason" and "catagory of each reason" and I found that 
         the most catagory effect increase churn rate is "competitor" with 44.82% churn rate, and
         I also found that the top 3 reason are (competitor made better offer, competitor had better devices,
                                                  Attidude of support person)
        -I found that california have the hightest churn rate with 60%.

3- Analyse and visualize data:
        -Now I wil do more analyses on the data and use visualization tools to make reports.
        -Senior more likely to churn than other.
        -Customer have monthly contract have more churn rate than other.
        -Churn rate decrease when lenght account increase.
        
4- Conclusion:
        - We should improve our servises to the customer so we can compite our competitor.
        - the states that have more churn rate than other mean that the compatitor promoting on it,
          so we marketing team should focus on this palces and make promotions.
