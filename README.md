# Churn_rate 
In this  project I used Power bi  to explore and analyze the data to determine what is the reason that lead to increase churn rate ,and what is the decision  that we can make to reduce it.


1- Data check :

        -check if the count of customer_id = distinct count of customer_id.
        
        -this check is particularly important, because in case there are
         dublicated rows we might double count cost later.
         
2- Explore data :

        -churn rate = customer loss/total customer = 26.68 which is high.
        
        -I use hierarchies on "churn reason" and "catagory of each reason" 
        
         and I found that the most catagory effect increase churn rate is "competitor" with 44.82% churn rate,
        
         and I also found that the top 3 reason are (competitor made a better offer,
                                                   the competitor had better devices, Attidude of support person) 
                                                   
        -I found that california has the hightest churn rate with 60%.

3- Analyse and visualize data:

        -Now I will do more analyses on the data and use visualization tools to make reports.
        
        -Senior are more likely to churn than other. -Customers  have monthly contract have more churn rates than others.
        
        -Churn rate decrease when the lenght account increase.
        
4- Conclusion:

        -We should improve our services to the customer so we can compete with our competitor.
        
        -the states that have more churn rate than others mean that the competitor promoting it,
        
         so our marketing team should focus on these places and make promotions.
